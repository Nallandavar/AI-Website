### Explanation:

1. **Imports**:
   - The code imports necessary modules and functions from the Flask library, as well as `os` to perform operating system-related tasks.

2. **App Initialization**:
   - An instance of the Flask class is created, usually to define the web application. Here, `app` is the name of the Flask instance.

3. **Image Upload Handling**:
   - An endpoint `/upload_image` is defined, and it accepts POST requests for handling image uploads.
   - The function `upload_image()` checks if a file is present in the request, validates the file format, securely saves the file, and then processes and saves the thumbnail.

4. **Video Upload Handling**:
   - Another endpoint `/upload_video` is defined to handle video uploads using a similar process to image uploads, validating the file type and securely saving the uploaded file.

5. **Server Initialization**:
   - The `if __name__ == '__main__':` block ensures that the server starts only if the script is run directly by the Python interpreter.

6. **Run the Server**:
   - The `app.run()` statement starts the Flask development server to serve the application.

7. **Error Handling**:
   - The code appropriately returns JSON responses with error messages if any issues occur during the image or video upload processes.

This code defines a simple web application that provides endpoints for image and video uploads, with basic error-handling and secure file saving. 
It's a starting point for building a more comprehensive web application with additional features and functionality. 
Further enhancements such as AI integration, thumbnail generation, and error handling can be added to meet specific requirements.
